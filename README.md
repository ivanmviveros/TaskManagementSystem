# Task Management System

Role-based task management: a Django 6 / DRF API and a React SPA.
Design spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-05-task-management-system-design.md`.

## Quick start

Requires Docker and Docker Compose.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py migrate
```

The API answers on `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/` and the SPA on `http://localhost:5173`.

`.env` is never committed; `.env.example` is the template and lists every variable the
stack reads. The `beat` and `worker` services need `config/celery.py`, and the `frontend`
service needs `frontend/package-lock.json` — until those land, bring up only what exists:
`docker compose up -d db redis backend`.

## Running the checks

Backend commands run against `backend/` through uv's `--directory` flag, so each is a
single uncompounded command. `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` is set in
`backend/pyproject.toml`, so tests need no environment variable.

```bash
uv sync --directory backend
```

```bash
uv run --directory backend ruff check .
```

```bash
uv run --directory backend ruff format --check .
```

```bash
uv run --directory backend mypy
```

```bash
uv run --directory backend pytest -q
```

The test settings use **Postgres, not SQLite** — the schema depends on partial indexes
and a check constraint that SQLite does not exercise the same way. `docker compose up -d db`
provides one on `localhost:5432` with the credentials from `.env.example`.

Lint and format locally exactly as CI does, via the pinned hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install --install-hooks
```

```bash
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push
```

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

`.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins the same ruff version that `uv.lock` resolves, so a local
hook and CI cannot disagree. The pytest hook runs on **pre-push**, not pre-commit, so
committing stays fast while nothing broken reaches the remote.

## Demo credentials

## Architecture

## Key implementation decisions

Full rationale for each is in the design spec's decision log (§3).

### D1 — Django `>=6.0,<6.1`, not 6.1

6.0 is the newest Django that *every* dependency actually tests against. DRF 3.18.1,
django-simple-history 3.13.0 and django-filter 26.2 cover both 6.0 and 6.1, but
simplejwt@master and drf-spectacular 0.30.0 stop at 6.0. Pinning 6.0 leaves zero untested
combinations while still satisfying the "Django 6+" requirement.

Trade-off, stated plainly: 6.0 left mainstream support when 6.1 shipped (Aug 2026), so it
is a security-fix-only branch. The exit criterion is D3's.

### D2 — Python `>=3.14` is a hard floor, not a preference

`uuid.uuid7()` entered the standard library in 3.14 (D28), so anything lower would need a
third-party UUIDv7 package. Django 6.0 officially supports 3.12–3.14.

Most of the dependency set is not individually verified against 3.14. The guard is the
`compat` CI job rather than a claim: `uv sync` fails outright if any dependency caps below
3.14, and it ran on day one before anything was built on the stack. It resolved cleanly on
Python 3.14.3 with Django 6.0.9, so the documented fallback — Python 3.13 plus the
`uuid-utils` package — was not needed.

### D3 — simplejwt from git, pinned to one commit

PyPI's 5.5.1 (Jul 2025) predates PR #959 ("add django 6.0 and python 3.14 support", merged
Feb 2026), which adds the Django 6.0 test matrix and replaces deprecated `pkg_resources`
with `importlib.metadata`. Master supports Django 6.0; the release does not. The pin is
commit `a7cb077ea0809f78cc6a99cb6825ab7594eae627`.

Consequences, all real:

- The backend image installs `git` so uv can resolve the git source.
- `uv.lock` captures the SHA, so builds stay reproducible (it resolves to
  `5.5.1.post36+ga7cb077ea`).
- **`pip-audit` and Dependabot cannot track a git pin**, so this one dependency sits
  outside automated advisory coverage.
- **Exit criterion:** revert to the PyPI package as soon as a simplejwt release containing
  #959 ships, then relax D1 toward Django 6.1.

### D4 — drf-spectacular 0.30.0 instead of drf-yasg

drf-yasg 1.21.17 still caps its classifiers at Django 5.2 and emits OpenAPI 2.0 only.
drf-spectacular classifies Django 6.0, emits OpenAPI 3.0.3/3.1/3.2, and is actively
maintained. `backend §35` permits either tool. This overrides the original brief's
nomination of drf-yasg, and costs nothing to anyone expecting Swagger — drf-spectacular
serves a Swagger UI at `/api/v1/schema/swagger-ui/` alongside ReDoc.

### D5 — uv as package manager

`pyproject.toml` plus a committed `uv.lock`. Required by the brief; `backend §44a` permits
uv or Poetry, used consistently.

## Deliberate overrides of AGENTS.md

| Override | AGENTS.md says | This project does | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Celery beat service** | root § Local Development: "Do not add further services beyond this (a beat/scheduler process, Flower, extra queues, Kafka)" | Adds a `beat` service to `docker-compose.yml` | The brief requires scheduled overdue notifications, which needs a periodic scheduler. A separate `celery beat` process is the standard, production-shaped arrangement; Celery documents `worker -B` as development-only. |
| **API docs tool** | `backend §35` names `drf-yasg` first | Uses `drf-spectacular` | D4. `§35` explicitly permits either. |
| **Dockerfile dependency install** | root § Local Development example uses `requirements.txt` + `pip` | Uses `uv sync` from `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`, and installs `git` | D5 (required by the brief) and D3. `backend §44a` already mandates `pyproject.toml` over `requirements*.txt`, so the root example is the outdated part. |

## Known limitations and exit criteria

| Limitation | Exit criterion |
|---|---|
| simplejwt is a git pin, outside Dependabot and `pip-audit` coverage (D3) | A simplejwt release containing PR #959 ships; move back to PyPI and relax D1 toward Django 6.1. |
| Django 6.0 is a security-fix-only branch (D1) | Same as above — D1 is gated on D3. |
| `ruff format` rewrites Python code blocks embedded in Markdown, which would edit the read-only `AGENTS.md` briefs | `AGENTS.md` is in `extend-exclude` in `backend/pyproject.toml`. Remove it only if ruff gains a narrower setting for embedded code. |
